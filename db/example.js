    description: "Over the past 15 years, the number of women dying due to pregnancy-related causes has dropped significantly worldwide. This is wonderful news. But in many of the countries where Doctors Without Borders/ Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) works, a shocking number of women still die preventable deaths. Some 800 women die every day due to pregnancy-related causes, the vast majority in developing countries, because they could not get the care they needed. MSF has projects in some 70 countries around the world. Most of our patients are women and children, and many of our waiting rooms and wards are full of pregnant women, women who are injured or ill, and women seeking care for their children. Our staff sees mothers walk great distances in dangerous circumstances to make sure their children get vaccinations and treatment, and risk everything, including rejection by their husbands, to prevent transmitting HIV to their unborn babies. These are remarkably strong women and they are anything but victims. Yet in spite of the huge burdens they shoulder, they rarely possess the power to decide when they themselves can get lifesaving care. These issues and the suffering they cause are not new or unknown, yet they still have not been adequately addressed. MSF has demonstrated that it doesn’t have to be this way; that simple, inexpensive interventions carried out by trained health staff can save many of these women.",

    title: "Vaccination For Meningitis Outbreak",
    description: "Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has deployed several emergency teams to Niger to contain a meningitis outbreak that has killed 179 people since the beginning of the year. Working closely with Niger’s Ministry of Public Health, MSF teams have vaccinated more than 358,800 people in the most affected areas while continuing to monitor at-risk areas and provide medical care to those affected by the disease. So far, the number of meningitis cases recorded across Niger this year has almost doubled compared to 2016 during the same period. The outbreak is affecting regions throughout the country, though the majority of the 3,037 recorded cases and 179 deaths between January 1 and May 7 occurred in the western part of the country. In response to the outbreak, which was declared by the Ministry of Public Health at the end of March, MSF supported a vaccination campaign targeting the regions of Niamey, Tillabéry, Dosso, and Tahoua. “As with the meningitis outbreaks of previous years, we have responded to the emergency in areas where the population has been the most affected,” said Félix Kouassi, MSF’s head of mission in Niger. “Our teams have supported the Ministry of Public Health in managing the vaccination campaign in several districts of the town of Niamey and also in the regions of Tillabéry, Dosso, and Tahoua, where more than 75 percent of cases have been recorded.” Meningococcal meningitis is a bacterial disease that causes serious infection of the membranes around the brain and spinal cord. Niger is part of the “meningitis belt”—a region that stretches across sub-Saharan Africa from Senegal to Ethiopia—and is regularly affected by this disease. Cases of meningitis C have been on the rise for several years. This year, 65 percent of meningitis cases have been verified cases of meningitis C, the main strain of this epidemic, and 18 percent have been verified as meningitis strain X. In order to implement the vaccination campaign in the areas affected, 341,000 doses were provided by the International Coordinating Group on vaccine provision. The rest of the vaccines were supplied by the Ministry of Public Health. Since the beginning of the year, MSF has been working with the Ministry of Public Health on rapidly treating meningitis patients and monitoring high-risk areas . MSF supported three hospitals and 24 health centers in the regions of Niamey, Dosso, Tillabéry, and Tahoua by providing them with supplies such as drugs, rapid diagnostic tests, laboratory kits, lumbar puncture needles, syringes, and even mattresses. MSF continues to monitor the areas that are at risk and provide support to manage cases. Emergency teams are also ready if the Ministry of Public Health needs support for a new vaccination campaign.",

In fact, according to United Nations Refugee Agency, one in every 122 humans is a refugee, internally displaced, or seeking asylum. These families are fleeing war, conflict, and persecution. In search of safety, they’ve left their homes with hope for the future. Hope of a better life for their children. As the world’s largest humanitarian network, Red Cross and Red Crescent societies and the International Committee of the Red Cross are banding together to serve tens of thousands of migrants, refugees, and internally-displaced people. Staff and volunteers tend to people on the move all around the world—this includes providing lifesaving support to people within Syria and along migratory routes in countries of origin, transit and arrival. Above, a slideshow of Red Cross Red Crescent activities throughout Syria and Europe. Over the past four years, the American Red Cross has spent and committed more than $2.5 million on relief efforts in Syria and its neighboring countries affected by conflict such as Iraq, Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan. As the crisis continues, the American Red Cross is providing information management and mapping support to the global operation to ensure that Red Cross and Red Crescent chapters are not responding independently of each other, but rather, have greater situational awareness of the broader crisis. This allows for informed decision-making at a global level and is essential for an emergency of this scale, which can overwhelm local Red Cross and Red Crescent branches. The American Red Cross has deployed eight disaster specialists to Europe and has provided 10,000 cots to help families in Germany.",

    title: "Using Fireworks to Save Elephants in Tanzania",
    description: "It’s a little after midnight on a Tuesday in June and a young bull elephant is foraging in near silence. There is no way for him to know that he’s wandered out of the boundaries of Tarangire National Park and is currently munching on corn in a family farm. It doesn’t take long before a bright flashing light appears in the distance, followed by the screeching of an air horn. While these unfamiliar lights and loud noises are usually enough to get an elephant to leave, this male seems unfazed. A few minutes later, an object shoots through the air, bursts open with a bang, and a cloud of chili powder overtakes the elephant’s senses. He quickly turns, and disappears into the grassland. Why are these men throwing chili powder at elephants? In order to save their lives. As more and more people turn to farming in corridors where elephants range, conflicts between the two cause huge problems. When an elephant wanders onto a villager’s farm, it can have a devastating effect: A single elephant can destroy someone’s food supply for the entire year in one night, trample property, and threaten a family’s safety. In the past, when an elephant made a wrong turn and ended up in a community garden, a villager used the only defense he had against a five-ton animal: a spear. A direct hit was always enough to chase her away…and make sure she would never come back. More than likely, she retreated into the park before succumbing to her wounds after a few days. But these villagers now have a better — if slightly unorthodox — way to redirect elephants away from their crops. Honeyguide Foundation, with critical support from The Nature Conservancy, has created a unique, four-step elephant alarm system to protect a villager’s food source without harming the elephant. ",

Our lands provide an untapped opportunity – proven ways of storing and reducing carbon emissions in the world’s forests, grasslands and wetlands, or natural climate solutions as we call them. More than 30% of the climate change goals that our world leaders established at the 2015 Paris Climate Convention can be achieved through the power of nature. This means that nature-based solutions – such as stopping deforestation and restoring coastal ecosystems – can get us more than a third of the way to the emission reductions needed by 2030. Let’s give nature back its power to protect us! Oceans, grasslands, wetlands, peat bogs, forests – when they’re destroyed, the carbon they hold is released into the air, and their ability to provide us with life-giving assets disappears. A huge part of our climate work, therefore, is continuing the work that we’re known for: saving nature.",

    title: "Saving Great Rivers",
    description: "From the snow-covered peaks of the Rocky Mountains to the sere, crackled plains of the Sonoran Desert, the Colorado River is a study in the interconnectivity of humans and nature. Nearly 40 million people depend on the river for clean drinking water, electricity, recreation and agriculture. Thirsty cities, including Denver, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and Phoenix, tap the Colorado, while irrigation has turned vast expanses of desert into the nation’s wintertime salad bowl. In all, the river contributes $1.4 trillion per year to the regional economy and can provide as much as 4,200 megawatts of hydropower, enough for more than three-quarters of a million homes. Yet that has all come at a tremendous cost to the environment. Since the early 20th century, the Colorado River has been so extensively manipulated that it no longer reaches its original terminus in the Gulf of California. Lagoons once teeming with fish and frequented by jaguars, coyotes and bobcats have become parched arroyos on the edge of the sea. What happens on one part of a river system has consequences elsewhere: Infrastructure projects fragment the Colorado, interfering with natural processes such as seed dispersal and fish migration. The Colorado pike minnow has seen 75 percent of its habitat disappear because of reduced flow. Reservoirs cool the water, making it less hospitable to native species, such as the endangered humpback chub, that evolved in warmer temperatures. Salts washed into the river from farms affect drinking water and irrigation supplies and harm fish downstream. And the reduced flow of fresh water from the Colorado into the Gulf of California may be contributing to the decline of the vaquita porpoise, the world’s most endangered marine mammal.",

The project will run through September 30, 2016. The high mountains of Central Asia provide freshwater for one-third of the world’s population, and habitat for the iconic and endangered snow leopard. However, climate change means rapid glacial melt and changing water availability. This results in pressure on endemic species, local and downstream communities, and agricultural productivity. In the face of a changing climate, this project aims to improve high mountain landscape management, both technical and policy-focused. It will help communities address vulnerabilities to climate change, conserve snow leopards as the flagship species of Asia’s high mountain landscapes, and advance a vision for water security and sustainable mountain development across the snow leopard range states.",

Freshwater habitats—such as lakes, rivers, streams, wetlands and aquifers—house an incredible proportion of the world’s biodiversity: more than 10% of all known animals and about 50% of all known fish species. Yet despite the massive role water plays for people and nature, it is a surprisingly finite resource. Less than 1% of the world's water is fresh and accessible. It’s also threatened. Climate change, population growth and changing consumption patterns are just a few of the myriad forces putting freshwater systems increasingly at risk. Freshwater species are declining at an alarming rate of 76%—much faster than terrestrial or marine species—and freshwater habitats are in worse condition than those of forests, grassland or coastal systems. Protecting fresh water cannot happen alone. WWF partners with governments, businesses, international financial institutions and communities to ensure healthy freshwater systems exist to conserve wildlife and provide a sustainable future for all.

    description: "It’s time to reconsider food. Around the globe, food production, distribution, management and waste threaten wildlife, wild places and the planet itself. Today, 7.3 billion people consume 1.6 times what the earth’s natural resources can supply. By 2050, the world’s population will reach 9 billion and the demand for food will double. So how do we produce more food for more people without expanding the land and water already in use? We can’t double the amount of food. Fortunately we don’t have to—we have to double the amount of food available instead. In short, we must freeze the footprint of food. In the near-term, food production is sufficient to provide for all, but it doesn’t reach everyone who needs it. About 1.3 billion tons of food are wasted each year—four times the amount needed to feed the more than 800+ million people who are malnourished. By improving efficiency and productivity while reducing waste and shifting consumption patterns, we can produce enough food for everyone by 2050 on roughly the same amount of land we use now. Feeding all sustainably and protecting our natural resources. WWF works to secure a living planet that will sustain a more affluent population. From refining production and distribution to combating waste and environmental impacts, we want to improve how the world grows, transports and consumes this precious fuel.",

As many as 25 million people are in danger of starvation in Ethiopia, South Sudan, Somalia, and Kenya — four countries where World Vision works. In northern Kenya, the people of Turkana have been hit hard. They are pastoralists who depend on seasonal rains that provide food for their animals. The animals, which serve as their food and their livelihoods, are nearly gone. Joseph Adome, who directs World Vision’s work in Turkana, says rainfall was measly last fall, just 100 milliliters, or 3.3 ounces — imagine a travel-size liquid container. Grasslands have turned into graveyards as the carcasses of donkeys, cattle, sheep, and goats litter the landscape, their ribcages white mounds jutting from the brown dirt. One community was named Nanaam, which means water. Now they call their village Ngikwasinyen, or dry sand, after a series of droughts. “There was a river here that used to flow with water,” says Nalet Ekapuon, 53. Ngikwasinyen was once a place of beauty, where pastoralists grazed their animals under shooting stars and the children would laugh and play until the sun went down. There was milk to drink and meat to eat. Now there is nothing but dry sand and dry bones. Their animals have died. They know they are next. Thousands of other families across East Africa are at risk of living similar stories.

Without intervention, animal hoarding situations will worsen, putting an increasing number of animals at risk. The ASPCA has a grant program in place to provide life-saving veterinary care and other resources to low income pet owners in New York City. By partnering with the local veterinary community, the ASPCA makes grants directly to service providers on behalf of the animal in need, preventing surrender or euthanasia. Grants are made to cover the cost of diagnostics and treatment of acute, one-time medical conditions and injuries. The ASPCA provides comprehensive wellness packages that include vaccines, micro chipping and spay/neuter procedures. Pet owners referred to this program typically want to keep their pets and can provide basic care, but are unable to afford the costs of emergency care and treatment. One in four women will experience some form of domestic or intimate partner violence in their lifetime. In a recent survey of women in a domestic violence shelter in Ohio, 42.5% reported an abusive partner harming or threatening to harm a pet. According to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, 25% to 45% of battered women stated that their pet was a barrier to them leaving an abusive situation, as they could not take their pet with them to a domestic violence shelter.",

    description: "There is currently an influx of kittens in Los Angeles County Shelters, and the ASPCA is urgently looking for kitten fosters who can help us save these vulnerable lives. Kitten fosters provide care and support to kittens until they are old enough to be adopted or receive a life-saving relocation to an area where they have a better chance of adoption. We currently have more kittens in need than we do fosters in our program. You can make a big difference by fostering a few of these vulnerable kittens, only for a couple weeks, and helping to spread the word about your experience to other prospective foster parents. We provide all the food, supplies and medical services, as well as all the support you can ask for—all we need from you is TLC. Fostering saves lives!",
